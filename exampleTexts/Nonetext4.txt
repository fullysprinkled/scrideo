For your purpose you could consider a well known pattern for event programming (Normally for IO purposes), reactor pattern. 
The idea 
is to decouple the application specific code from the reactor implementation. 
Under this pattern you will define a set of functions (h
andlers) that will be called when an event happens. Its a neat and organize way to handle event oriented programming.
