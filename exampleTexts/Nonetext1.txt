Let me address the questions as you have numbered them about the famous exchange between Jesus and the scribe in Mark 12:28-34.
Correc
t Understanding
First, if Jesus did not understand the Shema, then nobody will ever understand it.  Therefore, it must be axiomatic tha
t Jesus understood the Shema.
Scribe's Explanation
For what it is worth, I agree with the scribe's understanding (uncorrected by Jesus)
 in Mark 12:32, where he asserts that the Shema declares two truths:
the LORD is one (εἷς)
the LORD is God and there is no other (see a
lso Deut 32:39, Isa 45:5, 46:9, etc)

"Only True God" of John 17:3
First, whether one translates τὸν μόνον ἀληθινὸν Θεὸν as "only true 
God", or, "true God alone" makes little difference to the basic semantics.  This is partly due to the strictures of English because it 
would be poor English to translate "alone true God".
Second, "only true God" is the title Jesus chose here.  The Shema is a statement o
f factual truth as noted above.  By contrast, Jesus uses the title, "Only True God" as a form of vocative address in His high Priestly 
prayer in John 17:3.  Thus, the two, Shema vs John 17:3, are used in different contexts.
That is, "Only True God" is in apposition to t
he pronoun "you".  The sentence would make perfect sense if it were deleted as in "Now this is eternal life, that they may know You, an
d Jesus Christ, whom You have sent."  Thus "whom you have sent" is also in apposition to "Jesus Christ".
Lastly, the title of "True God
" also has good OT support in places such as: Jer 10:10, 2 Chron 15:3, etc, see also Isa 65:16, etc.  This, combined with the declarati
on in Deut 32:39, Isa 45:5, 46:9 (the LORD is God and there is no other), means that "Only True God" is a valid title for God as per Je
sus' prayer.
