OP asks, Did Jesus correctly state the Shema in Mark 12:29? Did Jesus and the scribe correctly understand the Shema? If so, was the sc
ribe's explanation correct? If so, why did Jesus abandon the language of the Shema when praying?
There is nothing in the bible that hin
ts, imply or expressly states that Jesus and the scribe incorrectly understood the language of the Shema.  Jesus himself said the Jews 
(Jesus included) worship what they know. John 4:22. Granting without accepting that Jesus is God, how is it possible that he did not co
rrectly understand the Shema? how is it possible that he did not correctly state the Shema?
John 4:22 ASV
Ye worship that which ye know
 not: we worship that which we know; for salvation is from the Jews.
The context of Mark 12:29 show the scribe's understanding is corre
ct.
If so, why did Jesus abandon the language of the Shema when praying?
There is no verse in the bible that show Jesus abandoned the l
anguage of the Shema when he prayed in John 17:3. The Father is a single Person and is the only God, as John 5:44 also show. Even after
 Jesus resurrection, the apostles worship the same God mentioned in the Shema as Acts 3:13 shows.
John 5:44 ASV
How can ye believe, who
 receive glory one of another, and the glory that cometh from the only God ye seek not?
Acts 3:13 ASV
The God of Abraham, and of Isaac,
 and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his Servant Jesus; whom ye delivered up, and denied before the face of Pilate, wh
en he had determined to release him.
There is no biblical support showing that Jesus abandoned the langauge of the Shema when he prayed
 to his Father/God in John 17:3. There is also no biblical support that Jesus is the God of the Shema.
